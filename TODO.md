# TODO

- Add a dataset loader module
    - data format validation (HRS format)
    - can load many datasets
    - both feature vectors and text data
- Add unique author ID naming (choose randomly selected names for each authorID)
- Add component for selecting a document, having that entire document text appear on screen, and showing the features (or counts) that were extracted?
- Add kNN visualization??


## Ideas

USER SELECTION ---> QUERY ---> QUERY HANDLER(DATABASE) ---> DATAFRAME ---> PROCESSING ---> COMPONENTS
