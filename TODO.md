# TODO

- Add a dataset loader module
    - data format validation (HRS format)
    - can load many datasets
- When author is selected, use that author's point color to color the dv points

## Ideas
- Add kNN visualization??
- Add component for selecting a document, having that entire document text appear on screen, and showing the features (or counts) that were extracted?
- Add unique author ID naming (choose randomly selected names for each authorID)?
